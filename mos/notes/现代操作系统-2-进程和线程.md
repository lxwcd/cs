现代操作系统 第二章 进程和线程

# 进程
-  A process is just an instance of an executing program, including the current values of the program counter, registers, and variables.

- 前台进程
foreground processes, that is, processes that interact with (human) users and perform work for them. 
- 后台进程
Processes that stay in the background to handle some activity such as email, Web pages, news, printing, and so on are called daemons.

Four principal events cause processes to be created:
1. System initialization.
2. Execution of a process-creation system call by a running process.
3. A user request to create a new process.
4. Initiation of a batch job.

## Process Creation
In UNIX, there is only one system call to create a new process: fork. 

This call creates an exact clone of the calling process. 
After the fork, the two processes, the parent and the child, have the same memory image, the same environment strings, and the same open files. 

After a process is created, the parent and child have their own distinct address spaces. 

Some UNIX implementations share the **program text** between the two since that cannot be modified.

Alternatively, the child may share all of the parent’s memory, but in that case the memory is shared **copy-on-write**, which means that whenever either of the two wants to modify part of the memory, that chunk of memory is explicitly copied first to make sure the modification occurs in a private memory area. 

No writable memory is shared. 

## Process Termination
通常造成进程终止的条件有：
1. Normal exit (voluntary).
such as execute **exit** system call
2. Error exit (voluntary).
3. Fatal error (involuntary).
4. Killed by another process (involuntary).

## Process Hierarchies
In some systems, when a process creates another process, the parent process and child process continue to be associated in certain ways. 
The child process can itself create more processes, forming a process hierarchy.

## Process States

## Implementation of Processes
To implement the process model, the operating system maintains a table (an array of structures), called the process table, with one entry per process. (Some authors call these entries process control blocks.) 

This entry contains important information about the process’state, including its program counter, stack pointer,
memory allocation, the status of its open files, its accounting and scheduling information, and everything else about the process that must be saved when the process is switched from running to ready or blocked state so that it can be restarted later as if it had never been stopped.
